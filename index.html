              <h3>About Me as a Reader</h3>
              <p>
                Literature has always fascinated me as a window into different
                worlds, perspectives, and human experiences. Before enrolling in
                Great Books, my reading was primarily for personal enjoyment and
                escape. However, this course transformed my approach to
                literature, teaching me to engage with texts analytically and
                thoughtfully. I learned to examine the deeper meanings behind
                stories—the symbols, themes, and social contexts that give
                literature its lasting power. What attracted me to this course
                was the chance to explore foundational works that have shaped
                literary tradition and continue to influence contemporary
                thought. My goal was to develop stronger critical thinking
                skills, broaden my cultural understanding, and learn how
                literature reflects and critiques the human condition. Through
                this journey, I've grown from a passive reader into an active
                interpreter who questions, analyzes, and connects literary works
                to broader human experiences.

              <h3>About the Course</h3>
              <p>
                Great Books is an intellectually enriching course that examines
                influential literary works spanning various cultures, time
                periods, and genres. The course challenges students to move
                beyond surface-level reading and engage with texts through
                multiple critical lenses, including psychoanalytic, feminist,
                Marxist, and reader-response approaches. By studying canonical
                literature alongside diverse perspectives, we explore
                fundamental questions about human nature, social structures,
                morality, and the power of storytelling. This course emphasizes
                close reading, analytical writing, and thoughtful discussion,
                encouraging students to develop their own interpretations while
                considering historical and cultural contexts. Through Great
                Books, I've gained valuable tools for literary analysis and a
                deeper appreciation for how literature both reflects and shapes
                our understanding of the world.

              <h3>Purpose of This Portfolio</h3>
              <p>
                This digital portfolio represents my intellectual journey
                through Great Books, showcasing six comprehensive literary
                analyses that demonstrate my growth as a critical reader and
                analytical thinker. Each analysis applies different theoretical
                frameworks to examine how literature illuminates the
                complexities of human experience, social structures, and
                cultural values. Through this collection, I demonstrate my
                ability to engage deeply with texts, construct evidence-based
                arguments, and articulate sophisticated interpretations that
                reveal the enduring significance of great literature.

            The Foolish Crane and the Mongoose This fable tells the story of a
            crane whose chicks are repeatedly eaten by a poisonous black snake
            living at the base of her nesting tree. Grieving her loss, the crane
            encounters a clever crab who offers a plan to defeat the snake.
            Following the crab’s advice, the crane lures a mongoose to the
            snake’s lair by leaving a trail of food. The mongoose kills the
            snake as expected. However, the solution soon backfires: the
            mongoose climbs the trees and begins attacking the cranes
            themselves, ultimately destroying them all. The story ends with the
            moral that solutions should not make problems worse, warning against
            actions that create greater harm than the original issue.

        <div class="content-box">
          <h2>Analysis and Interpretation</h2>
          <p>Archetypal Elements in the Story</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Snake as the Villain – The black snake symbolizes danger,
              destruction, and a persistent threat to the innocent, similar to
              classic villain figures in folklore.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Crane as the Victim/Hero – The crane represents those who
              suffer but try to seek a solution. Though vulnerable, she takes
              action to protect her offspring.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Crab as the Trickster/Helper – The crab plays a cunning role,
              giving advice that is partly helpful but also self-serving. This
              figure shows how guidance can be deceptive, reflecting the
              “trickster” archetype.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Mongoose as the Unintended Consequence – The mongoose
              represents the unpredictable results of using force or cunning.
              Although it solves the initial problem, it creates a bigger
              disaster.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using this archetypal lens connects the story to a larger
              tradition of fables worldwide. It illustrates how villains,
              helpers, and heroes appear in many cultures, and how these roles
              help teach practical life lessons about caution, cleverness, and
              the unforeseen consequences of our actions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Using the archetypal lens makes the story feel connected to many
            other tales across cultures. We recognize the snake, the hero and
            the helper because these character types appear in stories all over
            the world. Seeing these patterns helps us understand why the story
            is memorable: it teaches a simple but strong lesson about overcoming
            challenges using clever thinking rather than force.

            Psyche is a princess so beautiful that people admire her more than
            the goddess of beauty. This makes the goddess Venus jealous. She
            orders her son Cupid to make Psyche fall in love with a monster, but
            instead, Cupid falls in love with her. Psyche is brought to a
            magical palace by invisible forces, where she lives with a husband
            she is not allowed to see. Although she is treated with love and
            comfort, she becomes curious. Her jealous sisters convince her to
            look at him. One night, she secretly shines a lamp on him and
            discovers that her husband is Cupid. Surprised, she accidentally
            hurts him, and Cupid runs away. Sad and desperate, Psyche travels
            across the land trying to find him. Venus forces her to complete
            several hard tasks to prove her worth. With the help of nature and
            the gods, Psyche succeeds in all of them. In the end, Cupid takes
            her to the gods, she becomes immortal, and they marry. Psyche
            becomes a goddess.

          <h2>Analysis and Interpretation</h2>
          <p>Key archetypal and symbolic elements</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Psyche as the Soul</strong> – The name “Psyche” means
              “soul.” Her journey from mortal life, through loss, exile, and
              trials, to finally becoming divine reflects the soul’s path toward
              growth and spiritual maturity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cupid as Love and Guide</strong> – Cupid’s love for Psyche
              represents a higher, guiding force that leads the soul toward
              growth and immortality. Their hidden and initially forbidden
              relationship shows the deep, inner connection between love and the
              soul beyond appearances or society’s rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trials as Tests of Growth</strong> – The tasks given by
              Venus symbolize stages of testing and purification. Psyche’s
              patience, faith, and humility reflect the qualities needed for
              personal and spiritual development.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>From Mortal to Divine</strong> – Psyche’s transformation
              from vulnerable human to immortal goddess symbolizes growth,
              endurance, and transcendence—a common theme in myths showing that
              struggle can lead to something greater.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <em>Cupid and Psyche</em> is more than a love story; it is an
            allegory for the soul’s journey. It explores love, doubt, suffering,
            growth, and transformation. The trials Psyche faces are not just
            plot points—they represent inner, psychological, or spiritual
            challenges. The story shows that love based on trust and faith can
            lead to deep personal change.

            The story of Kulakog and Tilmag is about two animals who live in the
            same place but act very differently. Tilmag is hardworking and knows
            how to find what she needs, while Kulakog is lazy and depends on
            others. One day, their differences become obvious. Tilmag works hard
            to gather food and prepare for the future, but Kulakog does nothing
            and simply benefits from Tilmag’s effort. In the end, Kulakog
            suffers because of her laziness. The story shows that hard work
            leads to success, while doing nothing leads to failure.

          <h2>Analysis and Interpretation</h2>
          <p>Key Archetypal and Symbolic Elements</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Kulakog as the Hero / Worker</strong> – Represents hard
              work, effort, and personal responsibility. He is the typical
              “worker” who provides for himself and others.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tilmag as the Trickster / Dependent</strong> – Symbolizes
              laziness and taking advantage of others’ efforts instead of
              contributing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Conflict Between Effort and Idleness</strong> – The
              struggle between Kulakog and Tilmag reflects broader social
              tensions between productive and non-productive members of society.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consequences as a Moral Lesson</strong> – Tilmag’s
              suffering shows that rewards come from effort, emphasizing justice
              and accountability.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The story mirrors real-life social dynamics, where hard work can be
            overlooked and unfairness arises when some benefit without
            contributing. <em>Kulakog and Tilmag</em> is not just a moral tale
            about diligence; it also reflects ideas about fairness, society, and
            the value of labor.

            Morella tells the story of a man who marries a very intelligent
            woman named Morella. She spends her time studying deep questions
            about life, death, and the soul. After a long illness, Morella dies,
            but before her death, she talks about the soul living on and being
            reborn. Later, the man remarries, and he and his new wife have a
            daughter. As the child grows, she begins to look and act exactly
            like Morella. In time, the girl also dies, and the narrator realizes
            that she was the return of Morella. The story shows how the past can
            haunt the present and explores themes of identity, obsession, and
            the idea of coming back after death.

            A Rose for Emily is about Emily Grierson, a lonely woman who lives
            in an old, decaying house in her town. After her father dies, she
            shuts herself off from other people. She later spends time with a
            man named Homer Barron, but their relationship remains uncertain and
            strange. Emily refuses to accept change and continues to hold on to
            the past. When she dies, the townspeople enter her home and make a
            shocking discovery, Homer’s body is hidden in one of the rooms, and
            it becomes clear that Emily had been sleeping beside it for many
            years. The story shows how isolation, obsession, and a strict
            upbringing can destroy a person’s life.

            Psalm 23 shows trust in God as a caring shepherd who leads,
            protects, and provides for his people. Even when walking “through
            the valley of the shadow of death,” the believer does not fear,
            because God gives guidance, safety, and comfort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Job 38 is part of God’s answer to Job after his suffering. God asks
            Job questions about the world to show how large and complex creation
            is. Through these questions about nature, the universe, and living
            creatures, God reminds Job that His power and wisdom are far greater
            than human understanding.

            A formalist approach focuses on how literary devices—like structure,
            imagery, tone, and metaphor—create meaning. By looking closely at
            the text itself, we see how the careful use of language delivers
            spiritual and emotional impact, making messages of guidance, trust,
            and humility powerful and timeless.

              <h2>Collective Insights on Human Experience</h2>
              <p>
                Across the six texts I studied, a common idea about human life
                is the ongoing struggle between what people want and the forces
                that affect their lives. Whether the stories are about love,
                loss, identity, or inner conflict, they show how people try to
                understand themselves while dealing with life’s uncertainty.
                Many characters face moments that test their beliefs, push them
                to change, or make them confront difficult truths about who they
                are. Themes like resilience, weakness, moral choices, and
                emotional struggle appear again and again. These texts remind us
                that human experience is not simple. It is shaped by both our
                inner feelings and the outside world, which together influence
                what we do, what we believe, and who we become.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="carousel-card">
              <div class="card-number">02</div>
              <h2>Society and Culture</h2>
              <p>
                These texts also show how strongly society and culture affect
                the way people think and act. By using different places and time
                periods, the stories reveal how social rules, class divisions,
                traditions, and institutions shape what people can or cannot do.
                Many of the works show unfair differences between genders,
                social classes, or cultural groups, where some people benefit
                from privilege while others struggle against unfair systems. At
                the same time, the texts question the rules that society often
                treats as normal or unquestionable. By showing characters who
                follow, resist, or are harmed by these rules, the stories help
                us understand how culture can guide us but also limit us.
                Together, these texts show that literature not only reflects the
                society that creates it, but also invites readers to think
                critically about the world they live in.

              <div class="card-number">03</div>
              <h2>Theme: The Struggle for Identity</h2>
              <p>
                A common theme in many of the stories is the characters' search
                for who they truly are. Whether they are questioning their place
                in society, dealing with inner conflicts, or rethinking their
                beliefs, many characters face moments that make them confront
                their true selves. This theme shows up when characters resist
                outside expectations, challenge traditional roles, or try to
                understand their purpose. The stories show that identity is not
                fixed; it grows from personal experiences, relationships, and
                the pressures of the world around them.

              <h2>Theme: Power and Social Inequality</h2>
              <p>
                Another important theme is how power and social inequality
                affect people's lives. Many stories show how class, gender, and
                authority shape choices and limit freedom. Characters often
                struggle between those in power and those who are marginalized.
                The texts reveal how society creates systems that favor a few
                while leaving others at a disadvantage, and how people respond
                by following, resisting, or being affected by these systems.

              <div class="card-number">05</div>
              <h2>Theme: Change Through Conflict</h2>
              <p>
                Many stories also show how conflict whether inside a person,
                between people, or in society leads to change. Characters face
                challenges that make them adapt, grow, or see life differently.
                These struggles help them understand justice, responsibility,
                truth, or human nature. In these stories, change is not sudden;
                it comes gradually through effort, reflection, and resilience.

              <h2>Key Realizations</h2>
              <p>
                Studying these texts together helped me see how literature shows
                patterns of human behavior that appear across different times
                and cultures. One important realization is that, even though the
                stories come from different backgrounds, they all explore
                universal questions about identity, power, and morality. I was
                surprised to see how much society influences personal choices
                and how characters often face silent struggles shaped by rules
                and expectations they cannot escape. This changed my view that
                literature is only about individual stories; I now understand
                that each story also reflects larger social forces. I also
                learned that conflict often drives growth, showing that real
                change comes from challenges rather than comfort. Overall,
                reading these works helped me better understand the complexities
                of human life and the many things that shape who we become.

                This Great Books course has fundamentally transformed my
                approach to literary analysis and interpretation. Initially, my
                reading focused primarily on surface narratives and plot
                progression. However, through sustained engagement with diverse
                theoretical frameworks, I developed the capacity to analyze
                literature with greater sophistication and depth. I learned to
                examine characterization, symbolic systems, thematic complexity,
                and underlying ideological messages embedded within texts. The
                various critical lenses demonstrated that literature operates on
                multiple interpretive levels, each revealing different
                dimensions of meaning. I evolved from a passive consumer of
                stories into an active, questioning reader who interrogates
                texts, considers authorial choices, and connects literary works
                to broader philosophical, social, and psychological frameworks.
                This course enhanced my ability to identify significant literary
                details, construct evidence-based interpretations, and
                understand how literature illuminates fundamental aspects of
                human experience and social organization.

              <h2>Most Challenging Lens</h2>
              <p>
                The Psychoanalytic lens was the hardest for me. It made me think
                about the characters’ hidden feelings and motivations, like
                fears or desires they might not even understand themselves. At
                first, it was confusing to connect these ideas to the story
                events. By rereading stories like <em>A Rose for Emily</em> and
                focusing on clear examples of obsession or fear, I learned how
                to use this lens. It helped me notice the inner struggles of
                characters and understand their actions more deeply.

              <h2>Most Insightful Lens</h2>
              <p>
                The Reader Response lens was the most helpful. It showed me that
                reading is not just about the story itself, but also about how I
                respond to it. While reading <em>Morella</em>, my feelings of
                fear and curiosity shaped my understanding. This lens taught me
                to pay attention to my reactions and reminded me that different
                readers can interpret the same story in different ways. I plan
                to keep using this approach in the future.

              <h2>Impact on Thinking, Values, and Worldview</h2>
              <p>
                Reading these Great Books helped me think about life, society,
                and human nature in new ways. Stories like
                <em>Cupid and Psyche</em> and
                <em>The Crow and the Snake</em> made me reflect on love,
                intelligence, and morality. I also learned about fairness,
                resilience, and spiritual growth from texts like
                <em>Psalm 23</em> and <em>Job 38</em>. These stories made me
                more thoughtful, empathetic, and aware of human struggles. I now
                see literature as a way to better understand people, society,
                and myself.

              <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
              <p>
                This course was a valuable learning experience. It helped me
                think critically and reflect more deeply on stories. Using
                different lenses and reading a variety of texts showed me that
                stories are more than just entertainment—they teach lessons
                about life, human nature, and society. I will carry these skills
                and insights with me, not just in school, but in how I read,
                think, and understand the world in the future.
